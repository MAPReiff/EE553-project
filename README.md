# To-Do List
In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get overwhelmed with the number of tasks we need to complete in our daily lives. 
To-do lists are a simple and effective way to manage our responsibilities, ensuring that we stay on top of our priorities and achieve our goals. 
With the rise of digital technology, many people are turning to digital to-do lists as a more convenient and accessible way to manage their tasks.

## Core Features
Our C++ program will allow you to:
* Add, and remove tasks using user inputs.
* Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete, and can be attached with a due date.
* By default, tasks will be displayed to the user with a calendar. The user will have other options to change the display.
* Users will be able to import and export their to-do lists using file saves.
* Multiple users will be able to use the same program using user profiles.
